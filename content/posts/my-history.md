### My first interaction with the computer. 

I remember I was in second grade in school. My cousin who was studying 6th grade took me to his mathematics class. After that, we saw our grandfather. He said to my cousin "Did you show my room to the Azizim? (my grandfather used to call me like this). At that time I didn't know our grandfather worked as a computer science and mathematics teacher. 

So then we want to the room. I saw pupils working and learning computers. Then I sit on one of the computers and start to play keyboard games. This is my first interaction with the computer. 

In my school years. Textbooks were given by the school every year at the beginning of the academic year. Then I brought them home and read the computer science book first in 2-3 days.

Additionally, there were books related to the CS which belonged to senior classes. They were my grandfather's.

I've read about programming. It was written in the book that "Programming is communication with the computer, the programmer communicates with the computer through programming languages."

But I didn't understand anything. Why didn't I ask my grandfather about that?

Year after year. I finally got my personal computer. I think it was a quarantine. I have started learning programming from [Botir Ziyatov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f8cpjAz0sw&list=PLOvS2OkP87tSfos3rmPAhg9FqFDhbOcr1) on YouTube. My first programming language was Python.

I learned Python. followed by the aiogram. I made Telegram bots. after that, I entered the university in 2020. Because my computer is old, I sold it and bought a phone with this money.

Then my father brought me a computer. When I didn't know which language to learn, [Akmal Kadirov](https://www.youtube.com/@kadirovDev) appeared in front of me. After that, I started studying online php courses.

They taught from the beginning of the course. But since I have little knowledge of HTML CSS, I learned Laravel from [Sukhrob Nuraliev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVqHM-FgHFU&list=PLlvUmyq_t3vxWAppYSeDqsArW5vMIUIb2) before we learned Symfony (because Symfony framework was taught in the course).


One day, I was sitting in the university library thinking about what kind of project I should do for my portfolio, and when I looked at it, I saw that giving and receiving books, and registering students in the study hall were all on paper. After that, I started working on library automation.

The site was ready. I didn't know what to do now, so my fellow student saw what I had done and said, "Wow, it is amazing, show it to the dean." Then I went to the dean. I showed him. The Dean advised me to go to the IT Park of the University. So I'm working here.
