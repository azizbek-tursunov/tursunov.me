Experience is not years

Many people misunderstand the experience. Experience is not equal to years. Experience is equal to the number of experiences over the years.

Why do experiments? Looking for better ways of doing things. Trying to reach a different result.

Why seek better methods? Not satisfied with the current work, the result. So the current work will be analyzed.

If we put it in the formula, real experience = experiences conducted through analysis. It may take years for some to conduct a hundred experiments, and for others months.

If a developer with 5 years of experience has only done CRUD - his 5 years of experience is actually 1 year (repeated 5 times)

There are programmers with 1 year of experience who are more experienced than programmers with 5 years of experience.

Experience is measured in practices, not years. If you have few years of experience, but you have done good work, practices and solutions in excellent projects, don't be afraid to hand over to big jobs.

Experience is always measured in practices, not years. The harder and bigger the work you do, the more experience you will give.

"I have 3 years of experience" means nothing. Because the composition of years differs from year to year.
