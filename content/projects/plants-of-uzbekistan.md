[Plant diversity of Fergana Valley](https://pdfv.uz) is a web platform for Namangan State University's Faculty of Biotechnology, a project where I took **full control** of the development process â€“ from **frontend** design to **backend** logic, and even the implementation of DevOps practices.

### Key Features

- **Holistic Development Approach:** I undertook the end-to-end development of this platform, showcasing my prowess in both front-end and back-end technologies.

- **Interactive Mapping:** The integration of an intuitive __Leaflet map__, coupled with __Yajra DataTables__ for server-side rendering, ensures a seamless user experience and optimal performance, particularly when dealing with extensive datasets.

- **Efficient Image Handling:** Leveraging __FilePond,__ users can effortlessly upload and preview images before submission, enhancing the accuracy and quality of observations.

- **Custom Authentication System:** A bespoke login and register system with role-based access and middleware ensures a secure and tailored user experience. Admins have extensive privileges, including user management, observation status control, and data editing.

- **Admin Panel with Filament:** The admin panel, powered by __Filament__, provides a centralized hub for administrators to oversee user activity, manage observation statuses, rectify errors, and download data in __Excel__ format for further analysis.

- **Dynamic Components with Livewire:** Integration of __Livewire__ has enabled the creation of dynamic components, such as login/register modals and dependent dropdowns, adding a layer of interactivity and user engagement to the platform.

- **Multilingual Support:** Acknowledging the global audience, the website is accessible in both Uzbek and English, showcasing a commitment to inclusivity.

### Future Endeavors

As the project lead, I'm proud to have successfully navigated the intricacies of this multifaceted development process. Looking ahead, we have plans to expand functionality by creating a REST API, further elevating the platform's capabilities and promoting seamless integration with external systems.

This project reflects my ability to take charge of diverse responsibilities within a development project, ensuring not only functionality and performance but also a user-friendly and inclusive design.
